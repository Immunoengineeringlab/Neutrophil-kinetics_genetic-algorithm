# Neutrophil-kinetics_genetic-algorithm

parameters in the model are optimized minimizing chisquared value 

Genetic algorithm available in optimization toolbox in matlab is used for this optimization procedure.

run "runga.m" to run the optimization.

To change the neutrophil percentage data, goto "errorfile.m" and follow the data structure as specified in comments.
